##User Stories
* I do a lot of cooking and want to have a place to organize my recipes. I am constantly slightly changing ingredients and cooking times and would like to have an easy to see notes area so that I can keep track of changes and observations. I'd like my recipes to be easy to edit and easy to find. I'd also like to upload photos of my creations. 
* I'm constantly trying to figure out what to cook with ingredients that I have at home. I'd like to be able to search for recipes by ingredients and add them to a wishlist/to be cooked later. I like looking for things to try and having an accessible list, like pinterest, of things i"m interested in. I'd like to move recipes I've tried to a list of recipes I've made and have the ability to comment on that recipe about how I've made it.
